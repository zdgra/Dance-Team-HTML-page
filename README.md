# Fresh Off the Beat
An HTML page about my dance team that I made for my HTML class

My absolute favorite thing I did in college outside of school was Fresh Off the Beat, a dance team I directed and danced with for 2 years. When my HTML class assigned us to make an HTML page about our favorite hobby, I immediately knew that I was going to make mine about Fresh Off the Beat. I love this team to death and I had so much fun talking about them and making the page.
