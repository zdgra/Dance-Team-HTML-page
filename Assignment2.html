			<h2>Background</h2>
			
			<p style = "max-width: 600px;">
				My name is Zachariah Abueg (he/him), and Fresh Off the Beat is the beloved
				dance team that I danced with for two years!
				<br>
				<br>
				Fresh Off the Beat, or FOB, is an amateur dance team that stems from the
				Filipino Student Association at the University of Central Florida.
				We perform, compete, and host dance workshops at UCF and throughout
				the Florida dance community. Every semester, the team holds auditions
				and welcomes a new group of people to dance and bond together. By semester's
				end, we're as tight-knight a family as anyone of them could have ever
				dreamed of.
				<br>
				<br>
				From Fall 2017 to Spring 2019, I performed and competed with FOB. But it was 
				more than just dance, bigger than just dance. I met so many beautiful souls 
				throughout my seasons on the team, all containing multitudes. Some of the 
				funniest, most compassionate, most talented people I know, I met on this team.
				The friends I've made from it are invaluable to me and I'm so grateful to have
				been a part of this experience.
				<br>
				<br>
				In my second year on FOB, I was given the opportunity to lead this team
				alongside one of my best, most talented friends, Kylha DelosReyes, with the help
				of another two of my best, most talented friends, Kelly Mac and Jonathan Dioneda. 
				It was the craziest, most difficult thing I've ever had to do. Yet, with everyone 
				I danced with, laughed with, sung with, was fools with, "ooh ooh ooh ooh"d with - 
				it was also the funnest, dearest, most special thing I've ever done, all because 
				of the funnest, dearest, most special people I've ever been with. We danced our 
				asses off and ended up winning 3rd place at Def Talent Jam and 1st place at 
				PhilFest. It was a perfect culmination of our time growing and bonding together.
				<br>
				<br>
				Dancing with FOB is a cornerstone of my college experience. Spending two months
				with the same group of people sweating your life off in practice together is quite the
				way to bond together. I wouldn't have changed anything about it. There's a
				particularly grueling time of the FOB season we call Hell Week, which is when we
				have practices that are much later nights than usual in preparation for the
				upcoming competition of the season. It really takes a toll on everyone and 
				the very late nights make many of us take a backseat in either sleep or 
				academic performance. It's pretty tough. Yet, throughout that week and after it, 
				we take care of each other and become the closest we've been the entire season. 
				Come competition time, we bleed our souls out and leave everything we've got on 
				the floor.
				<br>
				<br>
				Going through the season of intense practices together and getting 
				through the hell that is Hell Week really bonds us and brings us together in a 
				way I've never bonded with anyone before. It's perhaps the most special thing
				about FOB to me, the thing that I hold dearest to my heart. I had the time of
				my life dancing with FOB, and it's all thanks to the beautiful souls I've been
				with on this team. 
				<br>
				<br>
				FOB Forever!

					<h3 id = "container1" style = "color: #B87DE8;">Def Talent Jam</h3>
					
					Every fall, UF's Filipino Student Association hosts a competition called
					Def Talent Jam, or DTJ, welcoming dance teams of Filipino student associations
					from all over Florida and Georgia. Every year, there is a different theme for DTJ
					and each team is tasked with a challenge. During my year of leading the team with
					Kylha, DTJ's theme was "Ako Ay", or "I Am" in Tagalog, and the challenge was to
					incorporate at least one Filipino cultural dance in a fusion piece. Our set's theme
					was "Ako Ay Sinta", or "I Am Love": sinta is an old-fashioned Tagalog word for love, 
					and calling someone your "sinta" has the same charm as calling them your "beloved" 
					or "darling". In our set, we followed a story of friendship, heartbreak, and love.
					Additionally, we chose to incorporate Sayaw sa Bangko, which is Tagalog for "dance 
					on a bench", a folk dance from the Pangasinan province of the Philippines.

					</h3>
					
					Every spring, Philippine Cultural Foundation, Inc. from Tampa hosts a competition
					called PhilFest Revolution, welcoming dance teams from all over Florida. Every 
					year, each team is tasked with the challenge of incorporating a Filipino cultural
					dance given to them. During my year of leading the team with Kylha, FOB was tasked 
					with incorporating Banga, a folk dance from the Kalinga villages of the Philippines 
					inspired by Kalinga women's daily routine of fetching water with bangas, or pots.
					Since there was no theme to abide by and thus no need to follow a story, we chose to
					create a set of the songs we wanted to choreograph to, just experimenting and having fun!

				<em>teach</em> it! It gives our members a chance to experiment, find themselves in
				the art, and just have fun!
